This extension is an add-on for Pocket, formerly Read It Later. It allows the user to add multiple links to their Pocket account at once, through the text they select on Chrome or by pasting links into the extension. All the hyperlinks/urls in the selected text are parsed by this extension. It is also possible to add common and custom tags to the selected links before sending them to Pocket.

Pasting links with tags is possible too. After each link add a space and hashtag sign '#' followed by one or more tags (comma separated). If no tags needed for a certain link, a hash tag followed by space is still needed if 'Parse with tags' button is pressed.
